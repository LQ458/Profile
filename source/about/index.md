## About Me

Hii! I am a high school student currently studying in [Basis International School Park Lane Harbor](https://biph.basischina.com/#/home?lang=en) in Huizhou, China. I've completed 4 AP classes [AP Macro and Microeconomics, AP World History, AP Physics 1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses), and I am studying 4 more AP classes [AP Calculus AB, AP Computer Science A, AP European History, AP Physics 2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses).

I am a self-taught programmer who mainly focuses on web development for now. I've already built several full-stack web applications using frontend framework such as React, Vue, Angular, and backend framework such as Express and nodejs. I am also familiar with other programming languages such as C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript (Typescript as well).
